## üìå Motivation
Accurate identification of sleep stages is crucial for health assessment and early disease detection.
However, manual scoring is labor-intensive and invasive. While current state-of-the-art ML/DL
models achieve high accuracy, they rely on EEG, EOG, and EMG signals which are invasive and
cannot be derived from thermal imagery. This highlights the need for non-invasive alternatives
for sleep stage classification

 This project aims to:
 
    1. Evaluate whether machine learning models using non-invasive signals can approach the performance of EEG-based models.
    
    2. Analyze key EEG features (e.g., K-complexes, sleep spindles, Œ±-rhythms, sawtooth waves) to understand their critical role as defined by AASM standards.

### Flow and Ribcage Signals(Non-invasive) for subjects
We observe the need to normalize the signals and apply smoothening

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
### Preprocessing: Normalization, smoothing (Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter).

### Feature Extraction (3 ways are experimented here):
1. Using TSFEL
2. CNNs
3. hand‚Äëcrafted statistical & physiological features.

### Modeling: Decision Tree based(XGboost, Random Forests), sequence‚Äëbased (BiLSTM), and attention‚Äëbased (Transformer) architectures.

### Evaluation: Accuracy and specificity on 2‚Äë, 3‚Äë, and 4‚Äëclass sleep staging tasks.

## üìä Why Specificity Matters
High specificity means fewer false positives in medical diagnostics:

Better resource allocation: Focus interventions (e.g., CPAP therapy) on truly affected patients.

Greater clinical confidence: Avoid unnecessary treatments caused by false alarms.

## ‚úÖ Conclusions
  Non-invasive signals can be used for simple Sleep/Wake classification in smartwatches, etc as accuracy is \textbf{0.83}.
    
  Feature engineering improves specificity of the classes significantly. Specificity is really important especially in medical domain, as it tells us how confident we are that the negatives predicted for a class are actually negative. For example:

  Medical Diagnosis: High specificity means that when a model says that a patient is not having a particular sleep disorder (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea), clinicians can confidently exclude that diagnosis. This prevents unnecessary treatments, medications, or interventions that carry their own side effects and costs.
    
Resource Allocation: In sleep medicine, treatments like CPAP therapy are resource-intensive. High specificity reduces false positives, ensuring these resources are directed to patients who truly need them.
EEG signals are critical for multi-stage classification (REM vs NREM, Light vs Deep, etc). but XGboost with appropriate feature extraction can be promising.
